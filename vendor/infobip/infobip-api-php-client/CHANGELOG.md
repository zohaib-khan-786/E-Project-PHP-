‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This release contains breaking changes!

### Changed
- Models, structure, examples, etc. for [Infobip SMS API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/sms)
- Library dependencies
- `README.md` which contains necessary data and examples for quickstart as well as some other important pieces of information on versioning, licensing, etc.
- LICENSE which is now MIT

### Removed
- Support for [Infobip Omni API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/omni-failover) (to be included back in one of the next releases)
